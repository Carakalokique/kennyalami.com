        <h3 class="main__title">Newsletter</h3>

          It's probably the thing I've enjoyed the most this year. I'd like to
          spend a bit more time on it. Almost every week, I receive a message
          from a subscriber telling me they've been enjoying the newsletter. I
          met cool people and connected some. I want to do more of that and I
          have a few ideas in mind. If you want to take a look, it's over
          <a class="nav__link" href="https://kennyalami.substack.com/">there</a
          >.

          I've been navigating having a tiny human. It's stretching my limit of
          how much chaos I can endure in my life. It was expected but still
          interesting to go through it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__title">Experiments</h3>
        <ul class="main__list">
          <li>
            <b>A Dollar A Day</b>: I set myself to sell once per day and make
            minimum $1 for 100 days straight. Read more
            <a class="nav__link" href="./dollaraday.html">here</a> and follow
            along on X
            <a class="nav__link" href="https://x.com/KennyAlami">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>SEO</b>: I obsessed over expired domain names and domain auctions
            a few months back. I bought a few and I'm doing some experiments on
            a few classic games like Solitaire or Sudoku. I launched them a
            couple of weeks ago so I'm waiting to see in the next couple of
            months where their traffic will be. A few early results but too
            early to conclude anything! Although all the new domains I launched
            now have a domain authority of more than 20. So that's a good early
            sign.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="main__title">Work</h3>

          I've been working with a few clients on

          >
          and I'm thinking of doing some cold outreach on LinkedIn and also by
          email. I'll redo my
          <a class="nav__link" href="https://automationk2a2.com/"
            >company's website</a
          >
          soon (it sucks right now).
        </p>
        <p class="main__paragraph">
          I might also push more my
          <a

            href="https://cal.com/kennyalami/one-hour-consultation"
            >automation consultations</a
          >. I like doing those because they are usually quite self-contained.
